# LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for text classification using Large Language Models (LLMs). The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretability.

## What Are We Building? (Explain Like I'm 5)
We're building a smart computer program that can read text (like movie reviews or news articles) and figure out what category they belong to. Think of it like teaching a computer to sort your mail into different boxes based on what's written on the envelope.

## Why Is This Important?
Companies like Adobe use these kinds of systems to help users find what they're looking for, organize content, and understand what people are saying about their products.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a modular, production-ready implementation of an LLM-based text classification system. The project showcases key machine learning engineering skills including:

- Data pipeline implementation (getting and organizing data)
- Model selection and evaluation (choosing and testing the best approach)
- Hyperparameter tuning (fine-tuning for best performance)
- Model interpretability (understanding why the computer made certain decisions)
- Production-ready code structure (organized like real-world software)
- Experiment tracking (keeping track of what works and what doesn't)
- Model deployment (making the system available for others to use)

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.8+ (the programming language we're using)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (tools for building AI systems)
- Hugging Face Transformers (pre-built AI models we can use)
- MLflow (tracking our experiments)
- Optuna (helping us find the best settings)
- SHAP/LIME (helping us understand the AI's decisions)
- FastAPI (making our system available over the internet)
- Docker (packaging our system so it runs the same everywhere)
