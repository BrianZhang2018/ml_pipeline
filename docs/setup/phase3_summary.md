# Phase 3: Model Development - Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 3 of our LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline project.

## What Did We Build? (Explain Like I'm 5)

We built the brain for our AI text-sorting machine! Just like teaching a child to sort toys by color, we built different parts of the brain that help our AI sort text by category. We created the thinking part (model builder), the teacher (model trainer), the notebook (experiment tracker), and the smart helper (hyperparameter tuner).

## Components Implemented

### 1. Model Builder Module
- Created functions to build transformer-based models using Hugging Face Transformers
- Implemented support for different architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, etc.)
- Added model configuration and customization options

### 2. Model Trainer Module
- Implemented training loop with PyTorch
- Added support for different optimizers and loss functions
- Included checkpointing and early stopping
- Added evaluation during training

### 3. Experiment Tracker Module
- Set up experiment tracking with MLflow
- Implemented logging of model parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Added model saving and loading capabilities

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuner Module
- Implemented hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- Defined search spaces for key parameters
- Added objective functions for optimization

## Modules Created

1. [src/models/__init__.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/src/models/__init__.py) - Package initialization
2. [src/models/model_builder.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/src/models/model_builder.py) - Model building functionality
3. [src/models/model_trainer.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/src/models/model_trainer.py) - Model training functionality
4. [src/models/experiment_tracker.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/src/models/experiment_tracker.py) - Experiment tracking with MLflow
5. [src/models/hyperparameter_tuner.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/src/models/hyperparameter_tuner.py) - Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna

## Tests Created

1. [tests/test_model_builder.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/tests/test_model_builder.py) - Unit tests for model builder (PASSED)
2. [tests/test_model_trainer.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/tests/test_model_trainer.py) - Unit tests for model trainer (ISSUES WITH ENVIRONMENT)
3. [tests/test_experiment_tracker.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/tests/test_experiment_tracker.py) - Unit tests for experiment tracker (PASSED)
4. [tests/test_hyperparameter_tuner.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/tests/test_hyperparameter_tuner.py) - Unit tests for hyperparameter tuner (PASSED)
5. [tests/test_model_pipeline.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/tests/test_model_pipeline.py) - Integration tests for complete model pipeline
6. [tests/simple_test.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/tests/simple_test.py) - Simple test script to verify functionality

## Challenges Faced

1. Environment setup issues with Python dependencies
2. Compatibility issues with some of the testing frameworks
3. Complexities in setting up proper mocking for unit tests
4. TensorFlow/PyTorch conflicts causing import issues in some environments

## Lessons Learned

1. Proper dependency management is crucial for ML projects
2. Mocking external libraries is important for unit testing
3. Modular design helps in testing individual components
4. Environment conflicts between TensorFlow and PyTorch can cause import issues
5. Simple test scripts can help isolate environment problems

## Workarounds

When testing the model_trainer module, we encountered environment issues related to TensorFlow/PyTorch conflicts. We verified that the core functionality works by:
1. Testing individual functions in isolation
2. Creating simple test scripts that don't rely on the full testing framework
3. Verifying that the compute_metrics function works correctly

## Next Steps

1. Investigate and resolve environment conflicts between TensorFlow and PyTorch
2. Complete testing of all modules once environment issues are resolved
3. Implement model evaluation and interpretability modules
4. Create deployment and testing modules
5. Finalize documentation and create example notebooks
