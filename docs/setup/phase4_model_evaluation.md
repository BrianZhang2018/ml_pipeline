# Phase 4: Model Evaluation and Interpretability

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 4 of our LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline project.

## What Are We Doing? (Explain Like I'm 5)

We're teaching our AI to explain its thinking and checking how well it learned! Just like when you show your artwork to your teacher and explain why you chose certain colors, we're going to make our AI explain why it thinks a movie review is positive or negative. We'll also check if it's really good at sorting the reviews correctly.

## Objectives

1. Create model evaluation module with multiple metrics
2. Implement cross-validation for robust evaluation
3. Add model interpretability using SHAP or LIME
4. Create visualization tools for model analysis

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Model Evaluation Module
- Create functions to calculate various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Implement confusion matrix generation
- Add support for different evaluation scenarios (binary, multi-class)
- Include statistical significance testing

### 2. Cross-Validation Module
- Implement k-fold cross-validation
- Add stratified sampling for balanced datasets
- Create functions for model comparison across folds
- Include visualization of cross-validation results

### 3. Model Interpretability Module
- Implement SHAP-based explanation generation
- Add LIME-based local explanations
- Create functions to visualize feature importance
- Include support for text-based explanations

### 4. Visualization Tools
- Create confusion matrix visualizations
- Implement metric comparison charts
- Add feature importance visualizations
- Include interactive analysis tools

## Next Steps

1. Create the evaluation module directory and `__init__.py` file
2. Implement model evaluation module
3. Create unit tests for model evaluation
4. Implement cross-validation module
5. Create unit tests for cross-validation
6. Implement model interpretability module
7. Create unit tests for model interpretability
8. Implement visualization tools
9. Create unit tests for visualization tools
10. Create integration tests for the complete evaluation pipeline
