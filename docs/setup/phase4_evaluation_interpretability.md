# Phase 4: Model Evaluation and Interpretability - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 4 of our LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline project.

## What Are We Building? (Explain Like I'm 5)

We're building tools to understand how well our AI brain works and why it makes the choices it does. Just like when you take a test at school, we want to see how many questions our AI got right. And just like when a teacher explains why you got a question wrong, we want to understand why our AI made mistakes.

## Phase 4 Objectives

1. Create model evaluation module with multiple metrics
2. Implement cross-validation for robust evaluation
3. Add model interpretability using SHAP or LIME
4. Create visualization tools for model analysis

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Model Evaluation Module
- Create functions to calculate various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Implement confusion matrix generation
- Add support for multi-class classification metrics
- Create detailed evaluation reports

### Step 2: Cross-Validation
- Implement k-fold cross-validation
- Add stratified sampling for balanced folds
- Create functions to aggregate results across folds
- Add statistical significance testing

### Step 3: Model Interpretability
- Implement SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability
- Add LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) as an alternative
- Create functions to explain individual predictions
- Add global feature importance analysis

### Step 4: Visualization Tools
- Create confusion matrix visualization
- Implement learning curve plotting
- Add ROC curve and AUC visualization
- Create feature importance plots

## Files to Create

1. `src/evaluation/__init__.py` - Package initialization
2. `src/evaluation/metrics.py` - Evaluation metrics calculation
3. `src/evaluation/cross_validation.py` - Cross-validation implementation
4. `src/evaluation/interpretability.py` - Model interpretability tools
5. `src/evaluation/visualization.py` - Visualization tools
6. `tests/test_metrics.py` - Unit tests for metrics
7. `tests/test_cross_validation.py` - Unit tests for cross-validation
8. `tests/test_interpretability.py` - Unit tests for interpretability
9. `tests/test_visualization.py` - Unit tests for visualization

## Dependencies to Install

We'll need to add these to our requirements.txt:
- scikit-learn (for metrics and cross-validation)
- shap (for SHAP interpretability)
- lime (for LIME interpretability)
- matplotlib (for basic plotting)
- seaborn (for enhanced visualizations)

## Expected Challenges

1. Installing SHAP and LIME without conflicts with existing dependencies
2. Ensuring compatibility with both PyTorch and TensorFlow models
3. Handling large datasets efficiently during cross-validation
4. Creating clear visualizations that are easy to understand

## Success Criteria

1. All evaluation metrics match scikit-learn implementations
2. Cross-validation works with different numbers of folds
3. Interpretability tools can explain individual predictions
4. Visualizations are clear and informative
5. All tests pass successfully
