# Phase 2 Summary: Environment Setup

## What Did We Do? (Explain Like I'm 5)
We built a special playroom just for our AI project! We created a separate space where we can keep all our tools without mixing them up with other projects. Then we filled this playroom with all the toys (software tools) we need to build our smart text-sorting machine.

## Why Was This Important?
Just like you'd be unhappy if someone mixed up all your different toy collections, computers can get confused when different programs need different versions of the same tool. By creating our own special space, we make sure our project has exactly what it needs and nothing interferes with it.

## What Did We Accomplish?
- Built a "virtual playroom" (virtual environment) just for our project
- Filled it with all the tools (libraries) we need
- Made sure everything works together nicely
- Created a setup that anyone can copy to work on our project

## What Did We Learn?
- Virtual environments keep projects organized and prevent conflicts
- Having a list of what we need (requirements.txt) makes setup easy for others
- Installing tools in the right order is important for everything to work

## What's Next? (Explain Like I'm 5)
Now that our playroom is set up and we have all our toys, we're going to:
1. Create a system for changing settings (like having different difficulty levels in a game)
2. Start getting the data we need (like collecting puzzle pieces before putting the puzzle together)

## Did Everything Work?
Yes! We successfully:
- Created a virtual environment
- Installed all dependencies from our requirements.txt file
- Verified that all tools are working correctly using our verification script

Our environment is now ready for the next phase of development.
