# Phase 2: Environment Setup

## What Are We Doing? (Explain Like I'm 5)
We're setting up a special playroom just for our project! Just like you might have a special box of toys that you only use for building with blocks, we're creating a special space on the computer where we can install all the tools we need for our AI project without messing up other projects.

## Why Are We Doing This?
Imagine if you tried to build a LEGO castle but all your LEGO pieces were mixed up with your toy cars and dolls. It would be hard to find the right pieces! The same thing happens with computer programs - if we don't keep our tools separate, they might conflict with each other or break.

## What Do We Need? (Inputs)
- A computer with Python installed
- Our project folder from Phase 1

## What Will We Get? (Outputs)
- A virtual environment (a special isolated space for our project)
- All the tools (libraries) we need installed in that space
- A working setup where we can run our AI code

## How Are We Doing It? (Technical Details)
1. Create a virtual environment (like a special folder for our project's tools)
2. Activate the virtual environment (tell the computer we want to work in this special space)
3. Install all the tools we need from our shopping list (requirements.txt)

## Key Concepts Explained
- **Virtual Environment**: Like having a separate toy box just for this project. Everything we put in here won't affect other projects.
- **Dependencies**: Like a recipe - we need all the ingredients (tools) before we can cook (run our program).
- **Package Manager**: Like a shopping assistant that goes and gets all the tools we need based on our list.

## Results
We now have a complete, isolated environment with all the tools we need to build our AI text classifier. Our virtual environment is set up and ready to use.

## Next Steps
1. Create configuration management system
2. Begin implementing data pipeline components
