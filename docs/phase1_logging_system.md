# Logging System

This document explains how our logging system works.

## What Is a Logging System? (Explain Like I'm 5)

Think of a logging system like a diary that your computer keeps. Just like you might write in your diary:
- "Today I learned how to tie my shoes"
- "I had trouble with math homework"
- "I played with my friends at recess"

A computer logging system writes down:
- "Started processing data"
- "Encountered an error with file X"
- "Finished training model successfully"

This helps us understand what the computer is doing, especially when something goes wrong.

## Why Do We Need This?

When our AI project is running, lots of things happen behind the scenes. If something goes wrong, we need to know:
- When did it go wrong?
- What was the computer doing when it went wrong?
- What were the specific details?

A logging system gives us this information, like breadcrumbs that show us what happened.

## How It Works

We'll create a system that:
1. Records important events during our AI training
2. Stores these records in files we can read later
3. Lets us control how much detail gets recorded

## Next Steps

1. Create logging configuration
2. Implement logging utilities
3. Test that the system works correctly
