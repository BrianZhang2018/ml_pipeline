# What's Coming Next: Phase 2 Preview

## What Are We Doing Next?

In Phase 2, we'll be setting up the environment where our machine learning system will run. Think of this like preparing your kitchen before cooking - we need to make sure we have all the right tools and ingredients.

## What Will We Learn?

1. **Virtual Environments**: Why we need a special "sandbox" for our project
2. **Dependency Management**: How to install all the tools we need
3. **Version Control**: How to keep track of changes to our code

## Why Is This Important?

Just like you wouldn't cook in a dirty kitchen or without checking if you have all the ingredients, we need to set up our development environment properly before we can build our AI system.

## Don't Worry About the Technical Terms!

We'll explain everything in simple terms. For now, just know that this step is like:
- Making sure your computer has all the right apps installed
- Creating a special folder where our project can work without disturbing other projects
- Setting up a system to track changes we make (like having a journal of everything we do)

This might sound technical, but we'll walk through each step slowly and explain everything along the way!
