# Phase 1: Project Setup

## What Are We Doing? (Explain Like I'm 5)
We're setting up our workspace - like organizing your desk before doing homework. We're creating folders to keep everything neat and tidy so we can find things easily later.

Think of it like building a house - first we need to lay the foundation and organize our tools before we can start building the walls.

## Why Are We Doing This?
Just like you wouldn't start cooking without organizing your kitchen, we need to set up our project properly before we can build our machine learning system. This makes it easier for others (and future you!) to understand and work with our code.

## What Do We Need? (Inputs)
- A computer with Python installed
- An idea of what we want to build (a text classification system)

## What Will We Get? (Outputs)
- A neat folder structure for our project
- Files that tell computers what our project needs to run
- Documentation that explains what we're doing

## How Are We Doing It? (Technical Details)
1. Creating folders (directories) to organize our project
2. Making a list of all the tools (libraries) we'll need
3. Writing instructions for how to set up the project
4. Creating documentation to track our progress

## Key Concepts Explained
- **Project Structure**: Like organizing your school supplies in different boxes - one for pens, one for notebooks, etc.
- **Dependencies**: Like a recipe - you need all the ingredients (tools) before you can cook (run your program)
- **Documentation**: Like writing notes in your homework so you remember what you did

## Results
We now have a clean, organized workspace ready for building our machine learning system. All the basic files and folders are in place.

## Next Steps
1. Set up virtual environment and install dependencies
2. Create configuration management system
3. Begin implementing data pipeline components
