# Glossary: Simple Explanations of Technical Terms

## A
**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Computer systems that can do things that normally require human intelligence, like recognizing images or understanding language.

## D
**Data**: Information that computers can work with. In our project, this is text like movie reviews or news articles.

**Dataset**: A collection of data organized for a specific purpose. Like a library of books organized by topic.

## H
**Hugging Face**: A company that provides pre-built AI models that we can use without having to build them from scratch. Like using a cake mix instead of baking a cake from individual ingredients.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Finding the best settings for our AI system. Like adjusting the temperature and time when baking cookies to get them just right.

## L
**LLM (Large Language Model)**: AI systems that are trained on huge amounts of text and can understand and generate human-like text. Like a very advanced autocomplete that understands context.

## M
**Machine Learning**: A way of teaching computers to recognize patterns and make predictions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for each task.

**Model**: In machine learning, a mathematical system that has been trained to recognize patterns in data and make predictions. Like a student who has studied many examples and can now solve similar problems.

**MLflow**: A tool for tracking machine learning experiments, so we can remember what worked and what didn't.

## O
**Optuna**: A tool that helps us automatically find the best settings for our AI system.

## P
**Pipeline**: A series of steps that data goes through to be processed. Like an assembly line in a factory.

**PyTorch**: A popular framework for building AI systems, created by Facebook.

## S
**SHAP**: A tool that helps us understand why our AI system made a particular decision.

## T
**TensorFlow**: A popular framework for building AI systems, created by Google.

## V
**Virtual Environment**: An isolated space where we can install specific versions of software tools without affecting other projects. Like having separate toolboxes for different hobbies.
