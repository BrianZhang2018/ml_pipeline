# Final Project Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of our LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline project.

## Project Overview

We have successfully implemented a complete machine learning pipeline for text classification using Large Language Models (LLMs). The pipeline includes all essential components from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## What We Built (Explain Like I'm 5)

We built a smart computer program that can read text (like movie reviews or news articles) and figure out what category they belong to. Think of it like teaching a computer to sort your mail into different boxes based on what's written on the envelope.

We also made it so other people can use our smart computer program by putting it on the internet, kind of like sharing a cool app with your friends!
