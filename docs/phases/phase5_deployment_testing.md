# Phase 5: Deployment and Testing - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 5 of our LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline project.

## What Are We Building? (Explain Like I'm 5)

We're building a way to share our AI brain with others! Just like when you build a cool Lego creation and want to show it to your friends, we're making our AI available for others to use. We're also making sure it works perfectly, like testing a toy to make sure all the pieces fit together correctly.

## Phase 5 Objectives

1. Build FastAPI endpoint for model serving
2. Create Dockerfile for containerization
3. Write unit tests for all modules
4. Create integration tests for the complete pipeline

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: API Development
- Create FastAPI application structure
- Implement model loading and prediction endpoints
- Add input validation and error handling
- Create API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

### Step 2: Containerization
- Create Dockerfile for the application
- Define dependencies and runtime environment
- Optimize image size for deployment
- Create docker-compose for multi-service setup

### Step 3: Unit Testing
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all modules
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Add mocking for external dependencies
- Create test fixtures and test data

### Step 4: Integration Testing
- Create end-to-end tests for the complete pipeline
- Test API endpoints with various inputs
- Validate model predictions and responses
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Step 5: Performance Testing
- Implement load testing for API endpoints
- Measure response times and throughput
- Test memory and CPU usage
- Optimize performance bottlenecks

## Files to Create

### API Development
1. `src/api/__init__.py` - Package initialization
2. `src/api/main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
3. `src/api/models.py` - Pydantic models for request/response validation
4. `src/api/endpoints.py` - API endpoint implementations
5. `src/api/model_loader.py` - Model loading utilities

### Containerization
1. `Dockerfile` - Docker image definition
2. `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service configuration
3. `.dockerignore` - Files to exclude from Docker context

### Testing
1. `tests/test_api.py` - Unit tests for API components
2. `tests/test_docker.py` - Tests for Docker deployment
3. `tests/test_integration.py` - Integration tests
4. `tests/test_performance.py` - Performance tests

## Dependencies to Install

We'll need to add these to our requirements.txt:
- fastapi (for API framework)
- uvicorn (for ASGI server)
- pydantic (for data validation)
- docker (for Docker testing)

## Expected Challenges

1. Managing model size in Docker images
2. Ensuring consistent environment between development and deployment
3. Handling API error responses gracefully
4. Optimizing model loading times for API responses
5. Testing with large models without consuming too many resources

## Success Criteria

1. API successfully serves model predictions
2. Docker image builds and runs correctly
3. All unit tests pass with high coverage
4. Integration tests validate complete pipeline
5. Performance tests meet response time requirements
