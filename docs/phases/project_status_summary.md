# Project Status Summary

This document provides a current status summary of our LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline project.

## Overall Project Status

‚úÖ **Implementation Complete** - All core functionality has been implemented across all 5 phases
‚úÖ **Docker Container Running** - The API is successfully deployed in a Docker container
‚úÖ **Basic Functionality Verified** - Core API endpoints (root, health, model info) are working
‚ö†Ô∏è **Network Issues Identified** - Model loading is experiencing connectivity problems
üöß **Documentation In Progress** - Phase 6 documentation tasks are ongoing

## Phase-by-Phase Status

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Project directory structure created
- Virtual environment with dependencies set up
- Configuration management system implemented
- Logging system for experiment tracking implemented

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Data ingestion module for various datasets
- Data preprocessing and text cleaning implemented
- Data validation module created
- Feature extraction using Hugging Face tokenizers implemented

### Phase 3: Model Development ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Model builder using Hugging Face Transformers
- Model trainer with PyTorch implemented
- MLflow integration for experiment tracking
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna

### Phase 4: Model Evaluation and Interpretability ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Model evaluation module with multiple metrics
- Cross-validation implementation
- Model interpretability with built-in tools
- Visualization tools for model analysis

### Phase 5: Deployment and Testing ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- FastAPI web service implemented
- Docker containerization completed
- Docker container is running on port 8000
- Basic API endpoints verified (root, health, model info)
- Unit and integration tests created and passing
- **Issue Identified**: Model loading network connectivity problems

### Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization üöß IN PROGRESS
- Comprehensive README documentation completed
- Example notebooks created
- Additional documentation in progress
- Final validation pending

## Current Working Components

‚úÖ **Docker Container** - Running successfully on port 8000
‚úÖ **Root Endpoint** - `GET /` returns API information
‚úÖ **Health Check** - `GET /api/v1/health` returns system status
‚úÖ **Model Info** - `GET /api/v1/models/{model_name}` returns model details
‚ö†Ô∏è **Classification Endpoints** - `POST /api/v1/classify` and `POST /api/v1/classify/batch` timing out due to model loading issues

## Known Issues

### Model Loading Network Issues
- **Description**: Containerized environment experiencing network connectivity problems when downloading models
- **Impact**: Prediction endpoints timing out
- **Status**: Documented and solutions proposed in [model_loading_network_issues.md](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/docs/setup/model_loading_network_issues.md)
- **Proposed Solution**: Pre-download models during Docker build process

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Model Pre-downloading** - Modify Dockerfile to download models during build
2. **Complete Documentation** - Finish Phase 6 documentation tasks
3. **Add Detailed Docstrings** - Enhance source code documentation
4. **Run Final Validation** - End-to-end pipeline testing
5. **Resolve Network Issues** - Test proposed solutions

## Success Criteria for Completion

- [x] All 5 implementation phases completed
- [x] Docker container running
- [x] Basic API functionality verified
- [ ] Model loading network issues resolved
- [ ] All documentation completed
- [ ] Final end-to-end validation passed
- [ ] Project ready for release

## Timeline to Completion

- **Week 1**: Implement model pre-downloading solution
- **Week 2**: Complete remaining documentation
- **Week 3**: Final validation and testing
- **Week 4**: Project release preparation

## Current Blockers

The only blocker to full functionality is the model loading network issue, which prevents the classification endpoints from working. All other components are functioning as expected.
