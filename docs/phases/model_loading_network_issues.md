# Model Loading Network Issues - Analysis and Solutions

This document analyzes the network connectivity issues experienced when loading models in the containerized environment and proposes potential solutions.

## Issue Description

When attempting to classify text using the API endpoints (`/api/v1/classify` and `/api/v1/classify/batch`), the requests time out. Analysis of the Docker container logs reveals that the model loading process is failing with network connectivity errors when trying to download model files from Hugging Face.

## Error Messages

From the Docker logs:
```
WARN  Reqwest(reqwest::Error { kind: Request, url: "https://transfer.xethub.hf.co/...", source: hyper_util::client::legacy::Error(Connect, ConnectError("tcp connect error", ..., Os { code: 110, kind: TimedOut, message: "Connection timed out" })) })
...
ERROR  Failed to load model 'distilbert-base-uncased': distilbert-base-uncased does not appear to have a file named pytorch_model.bin, model.safetensors, tf_model.h5, model.ckpt or flax_model.msgpack.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Network Connectivity**: The containerized environment is experiencing network connectivity issues when trying to reach Hugging Face servers
2. **DNS Resolution**: Some errors indicate DNS resolution problems
3. **Timeout Issues**: Connection timeouts suggest either network latency or firewall restrictions

## Potential Solutions

### Solution 1: Pre-download Models
**Description**: Download models during the Docker build process rather than at runtime
**Implementation**:
- Modify the Dockerfile to include a step that downloads required models
- Store models in the Docker image
- Update the model loader to use local models when available

**Pros**:
- Eliminates runtime network dependencies
- Faster model loading
- More reliable in restricted environments

**Cons**:
- Larger Docker images
- Less flexible for model updates

### Solution 2: Improve Network Configuration
**Description**: Fix the network configuration in the container
**Implementation**:
- Add DNS configuration to Docker
- Check firewall settings
- Increase timeout values

**Pros**:
- Maintains current architecture
- Smaller Docker images
- More flexible for model updates

**Cons**:
- May not work in all environments
- Still dependent on network connectivity

### Solution 3: Hybrid Approach
**Description**: Combine pre-downloaded models with fallback to online downloads
**Implementation**:
- Include commonly used models in the Docker image
- Fall back to online downloads for other models
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

**Pros**:
- Best of both approaches
- Flexible and reliable
- Good user experience

**Cons**:
- More complex implementation
- Requires careful error handling

## Recommended Approach

We recommend implementing **Solution 1** (Pre-download Models) as the primary approach with the following steps:

1. Modify the Dockerfile to download models during build
2. Update the model loader to check for local models first
3. Provide clear documentation on how to add new models

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Modify Dockerfile
See the example script [scripts/update_dockerfile_for_models.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/scripts/update_dockerfile_for_models.py) for guidance on how to modify the Dockerfile.

Example modification:
```dockerfile
# Add model download step
RUN python -c "from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer; \
    model_name = 'distilbert-base-uncased'; \
    AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name); \
    AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)"
```

### Step 2: Update Model Loader
Modify [src/api/model_loader.py](file:///Users/dong.zhang2/ai/ml_pipeline/src/api/model_loader.py) to check for local models first:
```python
def load_model(model_name: str, max_length: int = 512):
    """Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer."""
    try:
        # First try to load from local cache
        model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, local_files_only=True)
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, local_files_only=True)
    except Exception as e:
        # Fall back to online download
        logger.warning(f"Local model not found, downloading {model_name}: {e}")
        model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    # Rest of the function...
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation
Add instructions for adding new models to the Docker image.

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Implement Solution 1 in Dockerfile and model loader
- **Week 2**: Test with various models and environments
- **Week 3**: Update documentation and create examples
- **Week 4**: Final validation and optimization

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Models load successfully without network connectivity
- [ ] API endpoints respond within reasonable time
- [ ] Docker image size is acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated with new model management process
- [ ] Example notebooks demonstrate offline model usage
