# Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization - Summary

This document will summarize the implementation of Phase 6 of our LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline project.

## What Did We Build? (Explain Like I'm 5)

We wrote a really good instruction manual for our AI toy! Just like when you build something cool with Legos and want to show your friends how to build it too, we wrote down everything about our AI so other people can understand it and use it.

## Components to be Documented

### 1. Comprehensive README
- Main project overview
- Usage instructions
- API documentation
- Troubleshooting guide

### 2. Module Documentation
- Detailed docstrings for all functions and classes
- Module-specific documentation files
- Input/output format specifications
- Usage examples for each module

### 3. Example Notebooks
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating API usage
- Examples for each major functionality
- Visualization examples
- Performance benchmarking examples

### 4. Final Validation
- End-to-end pipeline validation
- Performance metrics documentation
- Issue resolution log

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Create comprehensive README with project overview
- [ ] Document all modules and their usage
- [ ] Create example notebooks for demonstration
- [ ] Run final end-to-end validation
- [ ] Resolve any outstanding issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete README documentation
2. Add detailed docstrings to source code
3. Finish example notebooks
4. Run final validation
5. Prepare project for release
