# Phase 3: Model Development

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 3 of our LLM-Based Text Classification Pipeline project.

## What Are We Doing? (Explain Like I'm 5)

We're building the brain for our AI text-sorting machine! Just like teaching a child to sort toys by color, we're going to teach our AI to sort text by category. We'll build the thinking part (model), teach it (trainer), keep track of its progress (experiment tracking), and help it get better (hyperparameter tuning).

## Objectives

1. Create model builder module using Hugging Face Transformers
2. Implement model trainer with TensorFlow/PyTorch
3. Add MLflow integration for experiment tracking
4. Implement hyperparameter tuning with Optuna

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Model Builder Module
- Create functions to build transformer-based models
- Implement support for different architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT)
- Add model configuration and customization options

### 2. Model Trainer Module
- Implement training loop with TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Add support for different optimizers and loss functions
- Include checkpointing and early stopping
- Add evaluation during training

### 3. MLflow Integration
- Set up experiment tracking with MLflow
- Log model parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Implement model saving and loading with MLflow

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Implement hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- Define search spaces for key parameters
- Add objective functions for optimization
- Include visualization of tuning results

## Next Steps

1. Create the models module directory and `__init__.py` file
2. Implement model builder module
3. Create unit tests for model builder
4. Implement model trainer module
5. Create unit tests for model trainer
6. Implement experiment tracker module
7. Create unit tests for experiment tracker
8. Implement hyperparameter tuner module
9. Create unit tests for hyperparameter tuner
10. Create integration tests for the complete model pipeline
11. Document all modules
12. Create Phase 3 summary
