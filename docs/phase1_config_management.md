# Configuration Management System

This document explains how our configuration management system works.

## What Is Configuration Management? (Explain Like I'm 5)

Think of configuration management like having different settings for a video game. You might have:
- Easy mode for when you're learning
- Hard mode for when you want a challenge
- Settings for sound and graphics

In our AI project, we need different settings for:
- Development (when we're building and testing)
- Testing (when we're checking if everything works)
- Production (when we're using it for real work)

## Why Do We Need This?

Just like you wouldn't want to play a game on the hardest difficulty when you're learning, we don't want to use the same settings for development and production. Configuration management lets us easily switch between different settings without changing our code.

## How It Works

We'll create a system that:
1. Defines different environments (dev, test, prod)
2. Stores settings for each environment
3. Lets our code automatically use the right settings

## Next Steps

1. Create configuration files for different environments
2. Implement a configuration loader
3. Test that the system works correctly
