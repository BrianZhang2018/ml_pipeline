Evaluation Module

This package contains all the modules for evaluating and interpreting 
machine learning models for our text classification pipeline.

What Is This? (Explain Like I'm 5)
===============================
This is like a report card and explanation toolkit for our AI. Just like
you get grades on your schoolwork and sometimes have to explain how you
solved a math problem, we use these tools to check how well our AI is doing
and understand why it makes certain decisions.
